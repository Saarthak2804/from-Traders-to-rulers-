        <h2>Reasons for British Success:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Disunity among Indian rulers: Rivalries and lack of unity prevented collective resistance.</li>
            <li>Technological and military superiority: British forces were better trained, paid, and equipped.</li>
            <li>Divide-and-rule policies: Exploited internal divisions among Indian states.</li>
            <li>Strong navy: British had naval supremacy, unlike any Indian ruler.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Miscellaneous Notes:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Subsidiary Alliances: Clever strategy to indirectly control states while maintaining a large army without direct costs.</li>
            <li>Doctrine of Lapse: Strategic annexation policy to expand territories.</li>
            <li>Famine of Bengal (1770): Highlighted the negative impact of Dual Government.</li>
            <li>Economic Exploitation: Following political conquest, the British began systematically exploiting India’s resources and people.</li>
